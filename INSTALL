REQUIREMENTS

1) The Gaming Ladder requires a web server with at least PHP version ??? running MySQL version ???.

INSTALLATION

1) Grab the latest ladder release from our /trunk from sourceforge SVN. 
You can either do it by checking them out or by browsing the SVN and pressing the download tar-ball-link at the bottom of the page.  
Url: http://gamingladder.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gamingladder/trunk/

2) Copy 'conf/variables.php.dist' to 'conf/variables.php' and edit the settings.

3) Copy 'conf/default_conf.php.dist' to 'conf/default_conf.php' Only the database settings are required initially. 
If you want an additional ladder, copy 'conf/default1_conf.php.dist' to 'conf/default1_conf.php', define the database setting and set the $G_CFG_multiladder in 'conf/variables.php' to TRUE

4) Create a database with any tool you like and then use the extract file from __EmptyDB_revX__.sql.gz as an import to your new database. The file is  located in the /conf directory.
A good tool to use for all this is phpmyadmin. 

5) Run index.php from the directory you've installed the ladder into and all should be working. Create a user that you want to make admin.
Once it's properly registered edit your database with your favourite tools and visit the table webl_players. In it you must locate the newly create dplayer and change his "is_admin" from 0 to 1. 
He/she is now an admin, and can login to the Admin interface by visiting http://yourladder.com/Admin using his user/pass that you created when you registered him/her.
