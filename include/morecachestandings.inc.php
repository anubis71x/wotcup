v1.0

Notice: This file should be included _directly_ after the standings cache has been done. It is not supposed to be run on it's own, nor is the first part of the cach supposed to be ran without running this directly after.

The original standings cache table creation was written by mr russ.

To avoid code confusion,. keep the files cleaner and easily re-use this code eyerouge decided to put it as an inc since it's supposed to be ran from
several different files. (At least when a game is reported, contested  or withdrawn, and also when the Admin re-createas the cache table)

Now that the ratings scache table has been created we'll get info about how many games each active player has played within the x most recent days and put it in there as well. Keep in mind we won't include such a value/result for those players that don't fulfill the minimum requirement of _at least_ x played games within y most recent days. So, in effect, the only players that will have values in the recently_played field are players we can consider to be active players (and yes, they also fullfill the requirement to have played at least z games to even be on the ladder to begin with, where z and eveyrhting else can be set in the config file..

We will now execute 3 queries where we will a) create a temporary table that is unique and valid for this sql session only. 2) Then select all users that have played >= number of games the most recent y days and also more than z games in total on the ladder, and put them into the temp table. 3) Lastly, update every user which is in the temp table in the standings cache table, which has already been created elsewhere in the code. The update will add/change the played_recently row the standings cache table. */
