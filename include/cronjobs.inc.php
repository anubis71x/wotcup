CRON JOBS

This file contains is a "task list" and contains all the tasks that we want to make sure will be executed once in a while by using the fake cron. 
The cron will run every task once when at least x minutes have passed since the last time the task was run. The fake cron is as the name suggests
not an actual cron - we've avoided using real cron jobs since most normal users won't have access to them on their web hosts.

As such the fake cron relies on somebody actually _visiting_ whatever php page that includes this file. In our default ladder setup that would be
the index.php.

Syntax for adding a new cron is:

	$x=new virtualcron(y,"z.txt");
	if ($x->allowAction()) { 
		echo "this triggered";
	}

Where $x is a unique variable identifying that task, y is minutes that have to pass until it's executed again, z is any unique filename. 

Current tasks that we use the fake cron for are:

	[ Rank Cache ] - Whenever a player reports a game or contests/withdraws a game the rank cache table is updated and displays the correct rank of everyone. However, what would happen if nobody playes a game in a day or two? And nobody contests one either? Rankings would then stand unchanged, but that's a problem since a part of how to calculate the rank of a player (actually if he has one at all) is to check for his activity during the x most recent days. So, if nobody playes for a couple of days it means that people that should be passive and lose their ranking are still seen as active and with a ranking since the last time the cache was update they were so. Because time moves along even when nobody reports a game, we need to insure that the rankings cache table is updated at least once a day. And thus we use the fake cron. Result logged if all went well is "Ok"

	[ Player Purge ] Once a week or so (configurable in config file) we want an automatic deletion of all players that have registered an account but not played a single game since they did so. Players with 0 games played can easily be removed from the db and really should within some intervalls since they add nothign to the anything except crap info to the db. Player purge can also be shut off alltogether from the config file. The result logged is "x removed".

	[ Daily Statistics ] Every day (1440 minutes) various statistics about the ladder are saved into a stats table. Result is various depending on the statistics.

	[Ladder Snapshot] Every day the cache table is archieved into the same or other database. Every archieved copy gets the name of the year_mont_date and enables correct display of the ladder at any date in history.
