 /*  Imagine a player needs to play 3 games within the 6 latest days to be conisdered as acive and not be marked as passive. 
	Let's say he has played 6 games within the 6 latest days. Suppose he distrubuted them as seen in:

	Date					Games played
	1 July Mon		  	1 
	2 July Tue			2
	3 July Wed			1
	4 July Thur			2
	
Today is Friday, the 5:th of July. He has never played games before 1 July and won't play any more games. Is he acive or passive? He is active. The 6 most recent days (30:th June to 5:th of July) he has played a total of 6 games. 

But what happens if we ask the same question the next day, on Saturday the 6:th of July - is he active then? Yes, if it is the 6 July and we look at the most 6 recent days the last thay we'd include would be 1:st of July, so no change there.

Again, what happens the next day - on 7:th of July? Now we must not count the result of 1 July since that date isn't part of the 6 most recent days any longer. So he has now played only 5 games since the games played on 1 July are not included any more. 

By counting this way and by cutting away one day (and it's games) at a time we can answer questions like "How many days does he have, today, until he becomes passive?" That's what we'll do in the below while-loop.
